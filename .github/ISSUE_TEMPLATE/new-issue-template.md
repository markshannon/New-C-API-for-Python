Please make new issues actionable.

In other words, there needs to be something that can be done to close the issue.

Issues don't need to be precise, but should do-able.

For example, "have you looked at Floob" is not actionable, whereas, "please add references to Floob" is actionable.

Better still, open a PR with the references to Floob.
